# examples-reddPrec

## Demonstration Examples

This repository includes reproducible examples illustrating the core features of the `reddPrec` R package:

- Gap-filling using statistical and machine learning methods  
- Gridded precipitation reconstruction with remote sensing covariates  
- Enhanced quality control of precipitation time series  
- Homogenization of precipitation time series  

## Run Demonstration Scripts

Before running the example scripts, install the stable version of `reddPrec` from [CRAN](https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.reddPrec) or the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/rsnotivoli/reddPrec).

Example scripts are located in the `scripts/` folder.

Each script is self-contained and includes comments to help you understand the process.
